# Case Study: Alien Colony Resource Optimisation on a Mars Settlement

## Context:
In the year 2045, humanity has established a colony on Mars. A group of aliens has recently joined the colony and requested access to resources to build their infrastructure and support their life forms. However, their resource consumption patterns are vastly different from those of humans, with fluctuating needs based on environmental factors, intergalactic events, and unknown biological cycles. 

Your task is to analyse the resource consumption patterns of the alien colony, predict future needs, and provide recommendations for optimising the distribution of Martian resources.

## Objective:
1. **Resource Forecasting**: Build a model to predict the future resource consumption of the alien colony, including power, water, and rare minerals, based on historical data and unusual influencing factors.
2. **Intergalactic Event Impact**: Identify how unpredictable intergalactic events (such as solar flares, asteroid flybys, or cosmic storms) impact the resource usage of the aliens.
3. **Optimisation Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for resource allocation to prevent shortages or overuse of critical Martian resources.

## Dataset:
1. **`alien_consumption.csv`**: Historical data on the alien colony's consumption of power (in gigawatts), water (in cubic meters), and rare minerals (in kilograms).
   - `date`: The date of consumption.
   - `resource`: Type of resource (e.g., power, water, rare minerals).
   - `quantity`: Amount of resource consumed.
   - `temperature`: Average daily temperature on Mars (can affect resource needs).
   - `galactic_event`: Whether any intergalactic event occurred on that day (0 or 1).
   
2. **`mars_weather.csv`**: Daily weather data on Mars, including temperature and solar radiation levels.
   - `date`: The date of observation.
   - `avg_temperature_celsius`: Average temperature on Mars.
   - `solar_radiation_kwh_m2`: Solar radiation in kilowatt-hours per square meter.

3. **`galactic_events.csv`**: Details on intergalactic events and their characteristics.
   - `event_id`: Unique identifier for each event.
   - `date`: Date of the event.
   - `event_type`: Type of event (e.g., solar flare, cosmic storm).
   - `intensity`: The intensity level of the event (on a scale of 1-10).

## Key Questions:
1. **How do the alien colony's resource needs fluctuate based on environmental factors like temperature and solar radiation?**
2. **Which intergalactic events have the greatest impact on the aliens' consumption patterns?**
3. **Can we predict future resource needs to avoid critical shortages or overconsumption?**
4. **What optimisation strategies should the Mars settlement adopt to efficiently manage resources for both humans and aliens?**

## Deliverables:
1. **Consumption Forecast Model**: Predict the alien colony's future resource consumption based on historical data, intergalactic events, and Martian weather conditions.
2. **Event Impact Analysis**: Provide insights into how different types of galactic events affect resource consumption, highlighting the most critical ones.
3. **Resource Optimisation Recommendations**: Offer clear recommendations on how the Mars colony should distribute resources between humans and aliens to ensure sustainability.

## Optional:
Build a **"Martian Colony Resource Dashboard"** that:
- Displays real-time resource consumption for both humans and aliens.
- Alerts colony managers about upcoming intergalactic events and potential resource shortages.
- Provides predictions and recommendations for adjusting resource allocation based on the forecast model.

## Expected Outcome:
At the end of the project, you should be able to:
- Present a forecast for future resource consumption, showing how it fluctuates based on Martian weather conditions and galactic events.
- Analyse the effect of intergalactic events on the alien colonyâ€™s resource needs, and identify the most critical events to watch out for.
- Provide actionable recommendations for optimising resource allocation to maintain balance between human and alien consumption on the Mars colony.
- Optionally, showcase a real-time dashboard displaying resource usage and predictions for future consumption based on your model.
